= Goals for the Arotna project

* Flexible content means reusing in unanticipated ways, for example, creating a Solution Pattern, creating an Antora website. footnote:[Both requirements are anticipated.]
* More new repos are being created every month.
* To support Pantheon v1, GitLab repos are created, or sync mechanisms are created.
* New standards are being introduced. footnote:[For example, repo layout]
* Existing standards are changing.
* Working with developers has never been more important.
* Working across projects has never been more important.

Leben aims to provide a toolset to:

* Analyse doc repos and report problems
* Document doc repos
* Encourage locating documentation with code/artifacts. footnote:[Not just code, for example, Service definitions, monitoring information]
* Make it easy to use nebel, antora, Solution Explorer
* Create new tools
