= Running Leben

Leben can perform one or more of the following tasks:

* Test your repo.
* Create reports of repo layout and content.
* Create a website of your repo.

Leben helps answer questions, for example:

* Does your repo conform to FCC layout guidelines?
* Does your repo conform to the content plan?
* How do I produce an upstream documentation site?

Using Open Source software for writing documentation should not be painful.
